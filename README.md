# Flightprice-predictions-model
Overview
Welcome to the Flight Price Prediction Model repository! This project showcases a machine learning model developed to predict flight prices based on various features such as airline, source and destination cities, departure and arrival times, travel class, duration, and more. The model aims to assist travelers and industry professionals in estimating flight costs and making informed decisions.

Features
Accurate Price Predictions: Our model leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions of flight prices, helping users plan their travel budgets effectively.

Data-Driven Insights: By analyzing historical flight data and relevant features, the model uncovers patterns and relationships that contribute to flight pricing trends.

Interactive Web Interface: Experience the power of machine learning through an interactive web interface. Users can input their flight details and receive an estimated price prediction instantly.

How It Works
The Flight Price Prediction Model is built using Python and popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. The model utilizes a neural network architecture to learn from historical flight data and make predictions based on user inputs. The model's performance is continuously evaluated and improved to ensure accurate results.
